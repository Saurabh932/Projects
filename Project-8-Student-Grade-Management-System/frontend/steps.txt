🚀 Step 1: Login Page — Implementation Coming Next

It will include:
• Email + Password fields
• “Login as Student / Admin” automatically handled based on backend response
• JWT token storage in browser (localStorage)
• Redirect to Admin or Student dashboard based on role
• Clean corporate styling (Blue + White)

Just confirming one thing before I generate the code:

➡ Do you want the login API to use:

POST /auth/login


with returned:

{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
      "uid": "...",
      "email": "...",
      "role": "admin/user"
  }
}


And when login succeeds:
• If role = "admin" → redirect to admin.html
• If role = "user" → redirect to dashboard.html
